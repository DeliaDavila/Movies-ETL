# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Project
This project was done to learn how to do ETL: extract, transform, load. 

## Project goals
The goals:

### Extract:
* Load data from various formats
* Extract values into dataframes for transforming

### Transform:
* Retrieve movie and ratings data
* Clean movie data set and reduce to a good working set for a hackathon
* Re-organize ratings data for optional use in hackathon
* Adjusting entries for consistency

### Load
* Confirming and adjusting data types 
* Creating visualizations to compare different data sets to determine most complete/clean
* Blend data and remove unnecessary/redundant information
* Load into a SQL database for easy retrieval during hackathon

## Results
Along with practicing the above skills, I learned:
* Troubleshooting within a function
* Setting up a timer to judge the length of a process
* Adding print statements to review a long process
* Cleaning up / making code linear after trying things out during development
